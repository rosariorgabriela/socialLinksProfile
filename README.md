### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Media Queries

### What I learned

I learned how to make a project fully responsive with CSS media queries, adjust layouts dynamically, and create hover effects for interactive elements like buttons with just CSS.

### Continued development

In the future I would like to:
- Explore more responsive design techniques.
- Add animations for a better user experience.
- Explore pseudo-class selectors in CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp) - This helped to change the background color of the buttons when the user hovers over it. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
